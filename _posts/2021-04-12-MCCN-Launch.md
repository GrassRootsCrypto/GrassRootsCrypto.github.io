Hi fellow THORChads and DeFi enthusiasts! It has been a while since I did a post, I have been caught up making videos, replying to YouTube comments, on the chat and doing a bit of travel. 

THORChain’s Mulitchain Chaosnet has launched so I wanted to do a post about it. This is the first time ever there has been a cross chain Dex – to swap tokens natively across different blockchains.  I created a number of videos leading up to the launch and one pre-launch video with real funds, listed below, plus some other interesting articles and videos that I recommend you watch to get a better understanding of THORChain. I hope you enjoy.
