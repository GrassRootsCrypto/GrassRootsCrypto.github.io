This is my first video on THORFI, and it was meant to be one video on Synthetics. However, the more I got into it, the more I realized it was too complex and complicated. Putting it all into one video would have been information overload, and I wanted to target less technical viewers first.
So, it is now a three-part series on Synthetics, with this one being an introduction for viewers before diving into the details. I have attached the graphics I used in PDF format for anyone who is interested, and I plan on doing this for all the videos in this series. Please use them responsibly.
