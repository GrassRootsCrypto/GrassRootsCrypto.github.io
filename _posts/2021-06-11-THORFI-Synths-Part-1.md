This is my first video on THORFI and was meant to be one video on Synthetics but the more I got into it, the more I released it was too complex and complicated â€“ putting it all into one video would have been information overload and I wanted to target less technical viewers first. 
So, it is now a three-part series on Synthetics, this one being an introduction for viewers before getting into the details. I have attached the graphics I used in PDF for anyone that is interested, and I plan on doing this for all videos in this series. Please use them responsibly.
