This is my long awaited THORFi video. I did a video on the 14th of March but it was not 100% correct and a few things have changed since so I have recorded a new video with the updates.
There is a lot of content here, so take your time. It is complex so it does take a lot of time to explain. My voice is not the best at times here, sorry, recovering from COVID at the time.
