With the implementation of THORFi, there are risks. This has been discussed at length on discord and in the twitter spaces.

I wanted to create a video to clear the confusion and get everyone on the same page.
What are your thoughts?

ADR 006 is currently open to enable POL, you can read that here: https://gitlab.com/thorchain/thornode/-/blob/develop/docs/architecture/adr-006-enable-pol.md 
Update, this vote was passed.
