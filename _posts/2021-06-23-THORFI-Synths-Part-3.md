This is my third and final video on THORFI where I wanted to bring it all together. I try to put Synthetics into context, explain how they are backed, and try to demonstrate that LPs and the protocols are the real winners of synths.
I feel and believe that if you truly understand Synths, you will understand that Synths are a tool to grow the protocol, serve the less informed, and really benefit liquidity providers. The truth is, LPs and the protocol directly benefit from the synth collateral, but the Synth holders do not; they get a fixed return. So the bigger the Synth uptake, the better it is for LPs and the protocol. This is an understanding few people will know without watching this video or obtaining very detailed knowledge. I hope you find it useful.
