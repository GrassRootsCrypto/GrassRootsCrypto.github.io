This is a video I wanted to do because there is confusion regarding Asymmetrical vs Symmetrical Deposits, Impermanent Loss, and Impermanent Loss Protection in THORChain. So I created an example to demonstrate these concepts, first at a high level for beginners, and secondly (yet to be created) at a more detailed level, where I can show how assets are priced in a pool and why Impermanent Loss is not properly understood. Googling, there isn't much information out there to properly explain it. I hope you find it useful."
