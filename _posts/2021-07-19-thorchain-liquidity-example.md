This is a video I wanted to do as there is confusion regarding Asymmetrical vs Symmetrical Deposits, Impermanent Loss and Impermanent Loss Protection in THORChain.
So I created an example to demonstrate these concepts, first at the high level for beginners and second, (yet to create) at the more detailed level, where I can show how assets are prices in a pool and why Impermanent Loss - few properly understand this and, googling, there is not much info out there to properly explains it.
