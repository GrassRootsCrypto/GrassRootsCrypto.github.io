Below is a video guide to THORChain's BepSwap interface. This covers how to add, swap, and remove funds using a real wallet.

In the video funds are added into the BNB:Rune pool, however the process is the same for any other pool. Remember there needs to be a 50/50 split of the asset and Rune in order to add to the Liquidity Pool.

While I used a Keystore wallet in the video, it can be access using a Ledger or the Trust Wallet App. 

BepSwap is a decentralised exchange where you can stake, swap and withdraw BEP2 tokens.
