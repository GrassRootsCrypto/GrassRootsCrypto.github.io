    <h2 style="color: #011936">I'm Chris GRC, founder of GrassRoots Crypto</h2>
      <p>
          I help individuals and businesses understand and adopt Bitcoin and crypto through education and consulting.
      </p>
      <p>
          With over 21 years in IT and 5+ years in crypto, I understand the challenges of navigating this complex space. There's so much information out there, it can be hard to know where to begin. My goal is to explain what you need to know using common, relatable examples.
