## Education, Training, Consulting, Advice

GrassRoots Crypto is a company dedicated to providing comprehensive education, training, consulting, and advice for users in the crypto space. I understand the challenges of navigating the complex world of cryptocurrencies, even with the vast resources available online.

If you are new to the crypto space, it can be overwhelming to make sense of it all. With so much to learn and numerous concepts to grasp, it's crucial to have a reliable source of information. However it can be difficult to know where to start.

### How it all started

GrassRoots Crypto was founded in 2019 with the mission of providing educational support to newcomers in the world of Blockchain / Crypto. I understand the challenges and frustration newcomers may go through when starting in the Crypto space. There is so much information out there, it is hard to know where to begin. So much new terminology and jargon!

When I started helping new people enter into Crypto, I noticed many videos used terms cryptocurrency terminology/jargon which new people just didn't understand. I wanted to do something different and that's how GrassRoots Crypto was born. My first videos were developed after the THORChain community had requested an instructional video series on THORNodes for current and new THORNode operators. This was my first time doing YouTube videos.

As my knowledge expanded, I felt compelled to delve deeper into various aspects of THORChain and expand my content to encompass fundamental DeFi concepts like Liquidity Pools, catering to newcomers seeking clarity.

Over the years, I have had the privilege of guiding numerous individuals on their journey into the crypto realm. This fulfilling experience has reinforced the purpose and vision of GrassRoots Crypto â€“ to empower individuals through education and support as they navigate the exciting world of cryptocurrencies.
