## Referral Links and Recommendations

Below are some referral links that can be used when signing up to new services. I recommend the below services as I have used them in the past. 
If you use them, both of us will receive a benefit, such as $20 free BTC.

### CoinSpot
CoinSpot is an Australian Exchange and one the easiest exchanges to buy and sell Crpyto. While the fees are not the cheapest, they are the simplest to used and I would recommend to beginners. 
"Refer a friend to CoinSpot and you will both receive $10 worth of Bitcoin* after they complete their first AUD deposit."

### Binance
Binance is the world's largest exchange by market cap. They have very cheap fees a very wide range of services however they are not simplest to use. Recommended for more advanced or quick to learn users. 
"This link will give you 5% back on fees"

### Celsius Network
Celsius is a deposit and lending platform. They offer over 10% interest on (like a high interest account) and loans from 1%. I believe they are the future bank of the world. 
Highly recommended as they will give you better deposit or loan rates than any bank!
"Join Celsius Network and earn $30 USD in BTC with your first transfer of $200 or more! #UnbankYourself"

### Cryptro.com
Crypto.com is similar to Celsius Network however it also has a Visa Debit Card. You can top up your card from either Crypto or another Credit/Debit card for no fees. Visa Debit Card comes with loads of benefits - recommended for all Crypto users. "Use my referral link and we both get $25 USD :)"
