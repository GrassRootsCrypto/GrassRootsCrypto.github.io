GrassRoots Crypto is a company dedicated to providing education for newcomers in the crypto space. I understand how challenging it can be to find the information you need, even with the power of Google. Sorting through the noise and finding the facts can be frustrating!

Entering the crypto space as a beginner can feel overwhelming, with so much to learn and numerous starting points. Understanding blockchain and cryptocurrencies requires knowledge in areas such as IT and finance.

Whether you're interested in expanding your understanding of cryptocurrencies, seeking guidance on where to make purchases, running your own Bitcoin node, exploring self-custody options, or aiming to comprehend DeFi, GrassRoots Crypto is here to offer the information necessary to propel your learning journey forward.

About the only thing I can’t do is provide investment advice or specific tax information :)
