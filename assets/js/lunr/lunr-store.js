        "title": "Understanding Liquidity Pools and Liquidity Providers",
        "excerpt":"Liquidity Providers can add funds/assets into a liquidity pool that allows traders to swap assets.  Liquidity Providers stake assets as they can get a good return on the amount they invest.  While BepSwap is used in this example, it applys to most liquidity pools.               General Terms  First, what is a Liquidity Pool? Liquidity is another term for money or funds that are accessible, like cash on hand - it can be accessed quickly.  A Pool of funds is a collection of funds in one place - like a pool of water in a swimming pool.  Liquidity Pool means a collection of accessible funds in one spot. The amount of funds in a pool is called its depth, just like a real pool. So, the greater amount of funds in the pool, the deeper the pool.   A Liquidity Provider is someone who provides funds to the liquidity pool. Adding funds or assets to a pool is known as staking or staking your assets.   It can get a bit complex from here, so I will give a real world relatable example.   Your local currently exchange would have a bunch of dollars in different currencies like USD, AUD, Pound and so on. Say I am in Australia and I want to travel to America, I would go to my local currency exchange and swap my AUD for USD at a conversion rate they set - usually a bit less than the actual exchange rate as the local currency exchange wants to make a profit. So now I have swapped one currency for another currency.   In this case, as the local exchange has provided the AUD and USD for swapping, as a company, they are considered to be the liquidity provider. I might want to swap it back later - so they actually need to hold AUD and USD. They are a company that holds funds to serve people who want to swap currencies, say for travelling to a different country. They might support many different currencies also like Pound, ERO, YPN - but is always done in a pair, in our situation AUD and USD.   Binging it back to Crypto  With something like BepSwap, many people have pooled their assets together into one place to allow other people to swap one cryptocurrency for another cryptocurrency. Note that in this case, it is not one company providing the liquidity, it is provided by many different people - e.g. it is not centralised, it is distributed or decentralised. In addition, like the AUD and USD example, crypto liquidity providers also need to stake 2 different assets of equal value to create a pool. Thus, a pool of a $1000 value will have a 50/50 split of two assets each to the value of $500.   Looking at a BepSwap pool, this would be the Binance Chain native token aka Binance Coin and Rune Liquidity pool with 50% Binance Chain native token and 50% Rune. You can then use this pool to swap Rune for Binance Coin or vice versa. The same principle applies to all pools.   Staking and Income  Liquidity Providers stake their assets to receive the fees from the people who swap assets.  Like with the local currency exchange, the person swapping the asset incurs a fee for doing so which is passed on to the liquidity providers.   It could be said liquidity providers are the same as the local currency exchange in our example, to the degree of the amount of funds they have contributed to the pool. Thus, if their contribution makes up 40% of the pool depth, they are like 40% of the exchange, and will receive about 40% of any fees incurred by the person who swaps assets using that pool.   Or put another way, people can use BepSwap to swap one BEP2 asset for another BEP2 asset, for example, swap Rune for Binance Coin and the people who provide the liquidity get to take the fee.   Lastly, liquidity providers can withdraw or un-stake their assets at any time, taking any profits they may have received while staking their assets.   Liquidity Providers can stake assets into a liquidity pool which allow traders to swap assets.  Liquidity Providers stake assets as they can get a good return on the amount they invest.   To sum up  Liquidity Pools are not new - they have been happening within the Ethereum space for a very long-time using systems such as UniSwap - there are so many, however it is all confined to the Ethereum ecosystem.   BEP2 assets are confined to the Binance ecosystem. Because each asset is confined to its own ecosystem, BepSwap is providing the same function in Binance as UniSwap does on Ethereum.   Currently there is no way for assets to natively cross ecosystems. While workarounds exist, there is no actual solution and this is the ultimate problem THORChain aims to achieve. But more on that in another video.   I hope this gives you an understanding of the basic concepts.  ","categories": ["DeFi","THORChain"],

        "title": "Impermanent Loss Explained",
        "excerpt":"This video helps people understand what Impermanent Loss is and asks key questions when considering your exposure to Impermanent Loss. If you are new to liquidity pools, check out my video explaining it.   NOTE: ILP has been sunset in THORChain.   Impermanent Loss (IL), or in simple speak, not yet a permanent loss, is one of the hardest concepts in DeFi for most people to understand.  See the video below.               The Risk  Impermanent Loss (IL) is a risk Liquidly Providers face when staking their assets in a liquidity pool. It is the potential difference in gains between holding and being a Liquidly Provider.   Most people seem to freak out about it because it sounds scary and can be difficult to understand and explain.   A few things that need to pointed out here.     The ‘loss’ is on paper only, and is not final - hence not yet permanent. It will likely change tomorrow. For example, BNB could return to its original price, eliminating the Impermanent Loss. The loss only becomes permanent when you withdraw from the Liquidity Pool.   If both assets rise in price by the same percentage, then it’s all good - the total pool value increases. The issue arises when the price movements are lopsided or when the pool becomes out of balance.   Price will always change, so the amount of Impermanent Loss or the amount you are ‘missing out’ on is always changing.   The fees you receive as a Liquidity Provider may have been more or less than what you missed out on. To understand your actual or net loss/gain, you need to subtract any fee revenue from the missed-out amount.   So why do it?  Why become a Liquidity Provider if you are exposed to the risk of Impermanent Loss?   AMM platforms like BepSwap (ThorChain) require Liquidity Providers to operate, so they make it very lucrative for them by offering a good share of the fees, additional ‘network benefits,’ and sometimes additional tokens for providing liquidity, which also hold value. Many are willing to take this risk due to the attractive rewards.   It must be said, however, the more the price moves, the more IL becomes an issue, and the IL can be greater than the income generated by fees or network benefits.   In other words, when price movements are small, the income generated generally covers the Impermanent Loss. But when price movements become very large, it may not be enough.   Key questions to ask yourself:     What are you trying to achieve? Are you looking to hold assets in the hope they will increase in value, trying to capitalize on every potential price increase? Or are you providing a service and getting paid for it, not worrying too much about every temporary price fluctuation?   What is your time preference? Are you in it for the short term or the long term? Are you interested in short-term trading or long-term asset appreciation, not being concerned with short-term volatility?   Remember, Impermanent Loss only becomes permanent when you withdraw!   Summing up  Impermanent Loss (IL), or in simple terms, not yet a permanent loss, occurs during the rebalancing process of a liquidity pool due to price movements. It is a risk Liquidity Providers face when staking their assets in a Liquidity Pool. The more the price moves (e.g., the more the liquidity pool becomes out of balance), the more Impermanent Loss becomes an issue. AMM platforms require Liquidity Providers to operate, so some may offer benefits/rewards to Liquidity Providers (particularly when they are new).   I don’t know your situation or what is best for you, whatever you decide to do, I hope you have a better understanding of IL.   Bonus - not in the video  Arbitraging - how it works?  How is this magic rebalancing process done when a pool becomes out of balance? When you stake into a Liquidity Provider, it is done at the market price - like the retail price. But once in the pool, assets have their own price, let’s call it the pool price. When there is an imbalance in the pool, due to price movements, the price of the assets (pool price) becomes different from the market price to encourage people to buy or sell assets in the pool to bring it back into balance. This is known as arbitrage.   Quick example  Say there is a BNB:RUNE pool and the price of BNB rises - the pool becomes out of balance.   To rebalance the pool, some BNB needs to be removed so the pool returns to a 50/50 split, and this is done by putting BNB on sale, allowing traders to buy BNB at a discount or below the market price. Remember, Liquidity Pools can set their own price, known as the pool price. Someone can basically buy the cheap BNB from this pool, then sell it at retail and pocket the difference. This is known as arbitrage, and there are computer bots that do this all the time, so the rebalancing is kind of an automatic process. Bots may have to work on a pool for a period of time, first making big trades, then getting smaller until balance is restored. Bots do this as they get to pocket the Impermanent Loss.

        "title": "THORChain Impermanent Loss Protection",
        "excerpt":"THORChain has implemented Impermanent Loss Protection in MCCN. If you’re not sure about Impermanent Loss, see here first. Once you have seen the video, you can read below for a more detailed explanation and learning.   Impermanent Loss Protection Explained               Additional Notes - How it is really asset based, not priced based.   THORChain does not care about the price at all. To get a price, it looks at the ratio of Rune to, say, BUSD to get the price of Rune, and then looks at the ratio of RUNE / BTC to get the price of BTC. This assumes that the pool is balanced. When you deposit, the amount of assets is recorded, remembering that all deposits (and withdrawals) are calculated symmetrically. If BTC doubles and RUNE stays flat, then the ratio will change to have less BTC and more RUNE. But funds are lost during the rebalancing process (by Arbing), so the amount of assets will be less than if you were just holding, even if the ratio is the same. When you withdraw, THORChain looks at what you deposited and what you are withdrawing and then compares the asset difference on each side to what you ‘should’ have if you were holding. It will pay out the difference. Note: the withdrawn assets include fees/revenue earned as an LP, hence the net difference, so the difference may be 0. THORChain works out from the asset amounts only. It can put a price on it as described above. This is what is done in the coverage section of the spec. This is combined with the protection part to find the % of payment you are entitled to (1-100%).   More Detailed information about Impermanent Loss   I have previously explained that Impermanent Loss is caused due to the rebalancing process, e.g., arbs taking funds from the pool. While at the basic level, it is a good way to think about it, it is not really true. Like with most things in Crypto, the deeper you go, the more complex it becomes and the more high-level explanations become false.   To be specific, Impermanent Loss is strictly caused by a change in the price of one or more assets in the pool. This will change the ratio of asset to rune in the pool, which will change the pool price. So one side will be selling at a discount, and the other will be at a premium. This then incentivizes arbs to take advantage of the price difference, as explained in my Liquidity Pooling video, which will then bring the pool back into balance. It is the change of the Pool price (due to the change of price) that causes IL, not the arb process. There are a number of distinct steps here; let’s use a BTC/RUNE pool here, but the process is the same for any pool with 2 assets in an AMM.      The price of an asset in the pool changes.   The ratio of BTC to Rune Pool changes in response to the price change.   Due to the ratio change, the price of BTC and RUNE is changed (either up or down, depending on the price movement). At this point, Impermanent Loss has occurred.   Now an opportunity is presented to arbs – however, they are not forced to take it.   Hope that helps!   Extra details from a write-up in THORChain Dev Discord. (Added 22nd Nov 21)   Below is as of version 0.75 of the code.   ILP is calculated within the withdraw_handler and does not care at all how liquidity has been added or how it is going to be withdrawn. ILP is calculated in RUNE (like everything else in THORChain), making it impartial to all/any assets. Only the ratio of the pool at the time of the withdraw is important. Let me lay it out.   The line if fullProtectionLine &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; pool.Status == PoolAvailable checks if ILP is active (protection line is taken from the constants (FullImpLossProtectionBlocks)) and if the pool is active.  ILP is calculated within calcImpLossV75 and uses the formula coverage = ((A0 * P1) + R0) - ((A1 * P1) + R1) – this puts all the values into rune. The calculation is then as simple as: rune value when deposited take rune value when withdrawing. If the result is &gt; 0, there is going to be a payout.   protectionBasisPoints (calculated previously form protectionBasisPoints := calcImpLossProtectionAmtV1(ctx, lastAddHeight, fullProtectionLine) is used to work out the coverage e.g. how many days the LPer has been in the pool. 100 days or more equals 100%.   If there is going to be an ILP payout, THORChain  adds the liquidity (the rune value of the ILP) to the LPer BEFORE the actual withdraw is done - thus their position (Liquidity Units) are updated before withdraw.   Note: Liquidity Units are denoted in RUNE (like everything is) so by incrementing someone’s liquidity units (e.g., RUNE) you are, by consequence, adding the corresponding asset value to the LPer, taking into consideration the ratio of the pool at the time. Thus, in general (at least at deposit and in this context), an LPer’s Liquidity Units are going to be the Rune side of the pool. Again, making THORChain processing impartial to all assets. That is how I understand it anyway 😊 See calculating-pool-ownership in the docs for the exact details.   After the ILP Payout is calculated, how the withdrawal is going to be done, e.g., Asym or Sym (done in calculateWithdrawV75) and the gas requirements for the withdrawal are calculated. The actual withdrawal of liquidity is then done.   Given this, it is clear that ILP is irrespective of how liquidity is added, removed, or even what asset is in question. Also, if there is a payout, an LPer’s position is updated before the withdraw process is done. I created this video going through a detailed example following the same process if anyone wants to know more or see a working example. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8cYaugKSFw YouTube.   What happens if you withdraw part of your liquidity?   withdrawBasisPoints is used to work out how much you are withdrawing, everything is actually calculated form that.        // taking withdrawBasisPoints, calculate how much of the coverage the user should receives     coverage = common.GetSafeShare(withdrawBasisPoints, cosmos.NewUint(10000), coverage)    Thus, given the following situation     1 April - Deposit RUNE+ETH @ 200:1   1 Aug - Withdraw 50% of LP @ 300:1 (ILP given)   1 Sep - Withdraw balance @ 400:1   Q: Will the protocol will give ILP based on 400:1 vs 200:1 and not 400:1 vs 300:1 right?   A: You will get the ratio at the time you withdraw. So 2 and 3 apply. This is done so it is a proper comparison against holding - at the time of withdraw.   Last note for the pedantic. V75 did update the ILP calculation to coverage = ((A0 * P1) + R0) - ((A1 * P1) + R1) =&gt; ((A0 * R1/A1) + R0) - (R1 + R1). (https://gitlab.com/thorchain/thornode/-/merge_requests/1993)   This works out the same as coverage = ((A0 * P1) + R0) - ((A1 * P1) + R1). V75 is just adding an additional check to see if R1*2 is greater than to or equal to ((A1 * P1) + R1), as (A1 * P1) the asset value into RUNE at the time of withdraw.

        "excerpt":"This is my third and final video on THORFI where I wanted to bring it all together. I try to put Synthetics into context, explain how they are backed, and try to demonstrate that LPs and the protocols are the real winners of synths. I feel and believe that if you truly understand Synths, you will understand that Synths are a tool to grow the protocol, serve the less informed, and really benefit liquidity providers. The truth is, LPs and the protocol directly benefit from the synth collateral, but the Synth holders do not; they get a fixed return. So the bigger the Synth uptake, the better it is for LPs and the protocol. This is an understanding few people will know without watching this video or obtaining very detailed knowledge.

Lots of passion, ideas and great engagement.   Solvency checker for the Asgard vault (YGG vaults are protected by the node operators and the incentive pendulum).  (#999)   Ability to stop single chains, instead of halting the entire network (#1013)   Halborn progress updates released. Here   Halborn Report on latest Hack here   What is happening.      White list ETH Smart Contracts (#1037, #1043)   Nodes can request halts   Increased delays for very large outbound transactions   Increased monitoring tools   Responsible disclosure and bounty program, now managed by NineRealms and Immunefi.   Halborn and Trail of Bits conducting security audits - structured review.   Code walk through for white/grey hat hackers by the team - adding community/involvement eyes on the project -  unstructured review   Taking some time while this is happening in the background.   Frequently Asked Questions   Official Medium Article with more information here           When will THORChain restart?       When it is safe to do so. Depends on how the security audits are ready. Current timeframe is about 6-8 weeks, thus about mid September.  A lot is happening in the background. Everyone wants it now but this is why it is called Chosnet, so please be patient while the team and the community works through this. Mods will post updates from the devs, so keep an eye on the pinned messages. Honestly, I think it is better to take the time now than rush it.    Draft timeline frin the team is here            What happened to my uncompleted swaps or withdraws?       The chain is halted so nothing is being processed. Everything is recorded, so if you have transactions, they should be processed when the protocol is fully restarted. The restart will happen in stages, look for details in the pinned messages. Won’t be able to do anything till then.            Do I still get block rewards / income as a LP?       Yes, THORChain will credit the pools with Rune while the chain is halted so LPs do not lose out. The Rune you get is based on your position so it is fair.            Do I still get ILP?       Yes, however it is measured in blockchain time, not in time passed, e.g. duration. Thus the time to 100 days is paused while the chain is paused. E.g., if the chain is paused for 5 days, you need to wait 105 days duration.            What happened to my RUNEYield? It’s showing $8k ETH price and -99.9% APY vs HODL for my ETH pool!       Firstly, don’t stress, this is not reflective of your actual position. The pools are currently out of balance which effects their price. Pools have their own price which is unrelated to the market price, and this is upset when the pool is out of balance, this is why everything looks strange. It will return to normal when, in this example, the ETH chain restarts. Then RUNEYield will start to look normal again.            Heard Team will make whole my LP pool. Does this mean paid in ETH? RUNE? Both?       As per point 3, LPs will get paid block rewards. There has been talk about reimbursing the pools however nothing is yet conformed, just too early. A lot of analysis is required for all of the consequences of the halt, this is just one of them. There will be more detail given closer to when the ETH chain restarts. Do not THORChain has a record of looking after LPs.            Heard team would suspend ERC20. What about ETH? What about my ERC20 LPs?       This has been suggested but it is too early to tell. The outcome of the security audits and the white/grey hacker review will help determine the path and timeframe moving forward. There will be more detail released once that has occurred.

        "title": "Bitcoin in SMSF",
        "excerpt":"I have done some write-up for friends interested in having Bitcoin in their SMSF so I have cleaned it up a bit and shared it on my website.   Exploring Bitcoin within a Self-Managed Super Fund (SMSF)   Bitcoin can be included in your superannuation, but exclusively through a Self-Managed Super Fund (SMSF).   Note: The information provided below pertains specifically to Australia. It’s strongly advised to conduct thorough research before making any investment decisions. Starting an SMSF is a serious undertaking.   SMSFs   An SMSF functions as a trust managed by a company, identified by its Australian Company Number (ACN). While there are alternative approaches, having a corporate trustee overseeing the trust is the preferred method.   SMSFs offer a diverse range of investment opportunities, spanning from traditional assets like stocks and bonds to alternative assets such as property, gold, artwork, wine, and cryptocurrency.   Benefits   Operating an SMSF provides numerous tax advantages, prompting many individuals to include their spouses and children in the fund. This approach is particularly beneficial for families with children.   An SMSF is treated as a single managed entity, with members not directly owning the fund’s assets – the fund owns the assets. Each member receives a yearly benefit statement, typically reflecting their contribution to the fund. Taxation within SMSFs mirrors that of traditional superannuation, including tax rates and contribution caps. Notably, capital gains tax (CGT) is taxed at 15%, but becomes CGT-free upon withdrawal post-retirement. E.g. if you sell at retirement, you don’t have to pay CGT.   Regulatory Considerations   SMSFs have extensive accounting and regulatory obligations, which is why you generally pay someone to do it, like you pay an accountant to do your taxes. Once established, the fund is regulated like any other super fund, e.g. searchable here Superfund Lookup. You can then choose for your employer to pay your super into that fund. Superannuation Standard Choice Form.   However, failure to comply with regulations can lead to deregistration by the Australian Taxation Office (ATO). To make things simple, I would recommend using your super to buy Bitcoin, hold it in your own cold storage and don’t touch it. This keeps the ATO happy, they can’t take it from you and also means you only care about the BTC price when you retire.   Cost   Setting up and maintaining an SMSF is costly, with initial setup expenses exceeding $3,000 and ongoing annual costs surpassing $2,100. These expenses are covered by the fund, though reimbursement may be necessary if initially paid by the individual. Funds must have sufficient cash to cover ASIC fees, super fund levies, accounting fees, and ATO charges.   Storage   Once you’ve purchased Bitcoin, you need to store it securely. The fund can cover expenses for cold wallets and other SMSF-related expenses. Recommended cold storage options include the Coldcard Mk4 or hardware wallets from Coinspot.io. Ensure you learn about cold storage before committing all your super to it.   Process      Establishing the SMSF: Engage professional assistance to set up your SMSF, ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements. Be prepared for initial setup costs and ongoing administrative expenses, which the fund will pay for.   Create a Fund Bank Account: Using a bank or credit union, open a transactional bank account for the SMSF, in the SMSF’s name. This will be a trading account for the SMSF and you can buy cold wallets and other SMSF expenses. A debit card is nice to have on this account but not all banks have this option. Note: CBA have hard $10K per month limit on crypto transfers, so not a good option.   Change your Super Fund: Use the Superannuation Choice form to change super funds that your employer pays into. Superannuation Standard Choice Form   Roll over your super to the new fund’s bank account: Superannuation Request for Rollover of Whole Balance Between Funds   Register the fund with an Exchange or OTC Provider: Register the SMSF with a reputable cryptocurrency exchange or over-the-counter (OTC) provider, for purchase and transfer of Bitcoin. Choose an Australian based exchange like Coinspot to keep things simple and keep the ATO happy.   Buy the Bitcoin and send to cold storage: Transfer the funds to the exchange you selected, buy the Bitcoin from the exchange then send it to your cold storage option.   SMSF Providers   There are many SMSF providers out there. They do the accounting and auditing for the fund and will be the main cost to running the fund. You will want to use one understands crypto; below are 3 recommendations but there are many more options out there.      New Brighton Capital: It was the only one around when I started and was recommended by crypto OG friends. They have great crypto API feeds to make crypto management simple, no lock in contracts (leave any time), however they are not the cheapest.   Esuperfund: A popular choice now and about the cheapest option. I have not used them however I have friends who use them and have heard good things.   Hardblock: Another option and a Bitcoin only exchange. They have a podcast on SMSF.   If you believe in Bitcoin, it’s a no-brainer, in my opinion. Just be aware that it will take time and effort to set up and manage properly.   A Test Case of an SMSF on 16 January 2024   Not financial advice, just sharing some thoughts. No one knows what will happen over the next 4 years. But here’s a hypothetical scenario: if you had $100,000 AUD four years ago and put it into an SMSF to buy Bitcoin, what would have happened?   If you had started an SMSF on 16th January 2020 with $100,000 to buy Bitcoin, you could have purchased about 7.8 BTC at $12,750 AUD per BTC. Current AUD value would be $493,800 at $63,316 AUD per BTC - as at 16th January 2024.   Accounting for SMSF fees of approximately $10,000 over four years there would be a profit of about $383,800 or $95,000 per year. This assumes the Bitcoin wasn’t traded and stayed in cold storage.   No one knows what will happen in the next four years, but it gives you an idea of why Bitcoin in an SMSF is a good idea despite the cost.   Early on, people advised me to buy Bitcoin in an SMSF, self-custody it, and leave it till retirement – I think it’s good advice.   You’ll need $3-4 million in super when you retire (accounting for inflation), and 10% compulsory super won’t cut it. You need a plan.  ","categories": ["Beginner"],

        "title": "THORChain + Cosmos Update",
        "excerpt":"A lot is happening with THORChain, so I’ve been doing research to understand it better. I wanted to dive deeper into COSMWASM, IBC, and the upcoming Kujira partnership. Using various sources, I used ChatGPT to create the following summary that I wanted to share with the community. Enjoy! This is just one part of the ongoing developments within THORChain which I will put into a video soon.   THORChain x Kujira Integration Summary   THORChain Overview   THORChain is a Cosmos-based blockchain designed for cross-chain liquidity and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. It is primarily known for enabling the swapping of native assets across different blockchains without the need for wrapped tokens or centralized exchanges. THORChain’s native asset, RUNE, plays a crucial role in liquidity provision, security, and the overall functionality of the network.   COSMWASM and Its Role   COSMWASM is a smart contract platform built for the Cosmos ecosystem, enabling Rust-based smart contracts within THORChain. It allows for the development of decentralized applications (dApps) and DeFi protocols on THORChain’s layer 2 (L2).   Benefits of COSMWASM      Custom DeFi Apps: COSMWASM enables the deployment of DeFi applications directly on THORChain. This includes decentralized exchanges (DEXs), lending platforms, and more.   Modular Contracts: Contracts can be deployed and updated modularly, with testing on a staging network before going live on the mainnet.   Native Asset Support: COSMWASM supports all native tokens within THORChain, allowing them to interact seamlessly within the smart contract environment.   Risk Separation   By adding features in the L2 space through COSMWASM, THORChain can de-risk changes to the L1 base layer. Experimental and innovative features can be implemented more quickly in the L2 space without compromising the stability of the L1 layer. This risk separation ensures that THORChain’s L1 remains stable, while the L2 layer can evolve with new features.   Kujira Integration   Kujira’s Features   Kujira brings a suite of DeFi protocols that will be integrated into THORChain’s ecosystem through COSMWASM:      FIN: The first on-chain order book for Cosmos, allowing decentralized trading with a 100% on-chain order book.   Orca: A liquidation platform that allows users to participate in liquidations, providing more decentralized opportunities for trading.   Ghost: A money market with significant TVL (Total Value Locked) that will take over THORChain’s Lending feature, offering a more robust platform for borrowing and lending.   BLUE: An overview of the user’s portfolio on Kujira, a full list of governance proposals as well as the ability to vote, and ability to mint USK   Pilot: A launchpad that will benefit from THORChain’s larger liquidity pool, enabling more capital to participate in new project launches.   Benefits of the Integration      DeFi on L2: Kujira’s DeFi protocols will run on top of THORChain’s base layer, acting as the application layer, and will be the first L2 on THORChain.   Increased Liquidity: Kujira’s platforms will gain access to THORChain’s deep liquidity pools, solving their current liquidity challenges.   Native Assets: Kujira will benefit from THORChain’s native asset support, moving away from reliance on wrapped assets.   User Acquisition: THORChain’s larger user base and decentralized liquidity will help Kujira overcome its challenges in user acquisition and volume generation.   Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) and Its Role   THORChain will also enable IBC for the first time. IBC is a protocol for transferring tokens and data across different blockchains within the Cosmos ecosystem. It enables interoperability between different blockchains, allowing them to communicate and transfer assets securely. Learn more about IBC below.   Benefits of IBC      Cross-Chain Liquidity: IBC will allow THORChain to tap into the liquidity and assets of other Cosmos-based chains, enhancing the variety of assets available for swaps and DeFi activities.   Asset Transfers: Assets from other IBC-enabled chains can be brought into THORChain, and THORChain’s assets can be transferred out, increasing the network’s utility and reach.   Enhanced Security and Redundancy: The ability to communicate with other blockchains can bolster THORChain’s resilience, offering more decentralized and robust security mechanisms.   Integration with Keplr Chain Registry   THORChain’s upcoming integration with the Keplr chain registry means it will be fully supported within the Keplr wallet, a widely-used wallet for Cosmos ecosystem assets. This will make it easier for users to interact with THORChain, manage RUNE and other assets, and participate in THORChain’s DeFi ecosystem.   Strategic Implications      Cosmos Integration: By enabling COSMWASM and IBC, THORChain significantly enhances its capabilities, supporting complex DeFi protocols and interacting with a broader range of blockchains. This positions THORChain as a more versatile and interconnected platform within the Cosmos ecosystem.   L2 Development: The development of L2 applications using COSMWASM will drive innovation on THORChain, potentially leading to a diverse range of DeFi products that leverage TOR and contribute to the overall ecosystem’s growth.   De-Risking L1: By focusing on L2 development, THORChain can maintain the stability and security of its L1 base layer while enabling rapid innovation in the L2 space.   Future Developments      Hard Forks: THORChain’s second hard fork is imminent, followed by another to integrate COSMWASM and Kujira. Full integration of Kujira’s apps is expected by September, after which focus will shift to expanding the ecosystem and enhancing user experience.   RUNE and KUJI Incentives: Both the THORChain and Kujira teams are incentivized for long-term development, with plans to align RUNE and KUJI holders with the success of the integrated ecosystem.   In conclusion, the integration of COSMWASM and IBC will position THORChain as a more powerful and interconnected player within the Cosmos ecosystem, with significant implications for DeFi development, cross-chain interoperability.

Source   IBC In detail   Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) is a protocol that enables different blockchains to communicate and transfer assets and data between each other securely. It is a fundamental technology in the Cosmos Ecosystem, which aims to create an “Internet of Blockchains,” where multiple independent blockchains can interoperate seamlessly.   How IBC Works:   Communication Channels:      IBC establishes communication channels between two blockchains, known as “IBC-enabled chains.” These channels are created through a process called “handshaking,” where both blockchains agree on a common communication protocol.   Once a channel is established, it can be used to send data packets between the chains. These data packets could include asset transfers, information, or even cross-chain contract calls.   Light Clients:      Each blockchain participating in IBC runs a “light client” of the other blockchain. A light client is a lightweight version of the blockchain that only stores the necessary information to verify the state of the other blockchain (such as the latest block header).   This light client ensures that the data being sent between the two blockchains is valid and that both blockchains are in sync.   Transaction Process:      When an asset transfer is initiated, the sending blockchain locks the asset in a specific smart contract or module. This action is recorded on the blockchain, and a proof of this transaction (a cryptographic proof) is generated.   The proof is then sent through the IBC channel to the receiving blockchain, where the light client verifies the proof.   Once verified, the receiving blockchain mints a corresponding asset (or recognizes the asset) and credits it to the recipient’s account. This ensures that assets transferred via IBC are unique and cannot be duplicated.   This process ensures that the asset is not duplicated, and only one valid version of the asset exists across both blockchains.   Security:      IBC relies on the security of the underlying blockchains. Since each blockchain independently verifies transactions and states, the protocol itself does not need to rely on a central authority or intermediary.   The security of IBC comes from the consensus mechanisms of the participating blockchains and the cryptographic proofs exchanged between them.   How Asset Transfer Works with IBC:           Lock and Mint:   • On the sending blockchain, an asset (e.g., tokens) is locked in a specific IBC module or contract. This means the asset is effectively frozen and cannot be used on the sending blockchain while it’s locked.   • A proof of this lock is generated and sent to the receiving blockchain.            Verification and Minting:   • The receiving blockchain, upon receiving the proof, verifies it using its light client. If the proof is valid, the receiving blockchain mints a corresponding token (or recognizes the asset) and credits it to the recipient’s account.   • The minted token represents the original asset but is now usable on the receiving blockchain.            Unlock and Burn (Reverse Process):   • If the user wants to move the asset back to the original blockchain, they can initiate a reverse process. The minted token on the receiving blockchain is burned (destroyed), and a proof of this burn is sent back to the original blockchain.   • Upon verification, the original asset is unlocked and returned to the user’s account on the original blockchain.       Benefits of IBC for THORChain:      Cross-Chain Liquidity: IBC allows THORChain to access and provide liquidity for assets from other blockchains within the Cosmos Ecosystem, expanding the range of assets and markets available on THORChain.   Interoperability: IBC enables THORChain to interact with other blockchains, supporting cross-chain applications, data sharing, and decentralized exchanges.   Decentralization and Security: IBC’s reliance on light clients and cryptographic proofs ensures that asset transfers are secure and do not depend on centralized intermediaries.   Expansion of the Ecosystem: With IBC, THORChain can integrate with a broader range of blockchains, bringing in more users, assets, and applications into its ecosystem, thereby increasing its overall utility and value proposition.

        "title": "THORChain February Update",
        "excerpt":"I wanted create a post about THORChain as a lot has happened this year. The biggest update is regarding THORFi and there is a lot to unpack, so I will leave it to the article below to do that.   Introduction   THORChain has paused THORFi features and initiated the process of unwinding its lending and savings programs to resolve outstanding liabilities and stabilise the network. This article provides an objective and detailed account of the events, key decisions, and technical actions undertaken to stabilise the network and chart a path forward.   THORFi Background   The THORFi suite, which includes Savers and Lending, was designed to expand the utility of the THORChain ecosystem. Over time, however, concerns about the growing liabilities and potential risks to network stability intensified. By January 2025, these concerns culminated in critical events that have reshaped the network’s future.   Both Savers and Lending relied on the assumption that RUNE would outperform, or at least not significantly underperform, major assets used within THORFi. Specifically:           Savers: Savers introduced leverage into the pool, which is a double-edged sword. If the pool grew, Dual Liquidity Providers (DLPs) would receive greater returns than they normally would. Conversely, if the pool shrank due to impermanent loss (IL), DLPs would be disproportionately impacted. IL is a slippery slope—when RUNE underperforms relative to other assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum, IL worsens, negatively affecting both DLPs and the overall pool.            Lending: The lending mechanism involved burning RUNE to create loans and minting RUNE to close them. The ratio of RUNE to the collateral asset was set at loan opening and closure. If RUNE performed poorly after loans were opened, more RUNE would be minted upon closure than was initially burned. While a circuit breaker was in place to cap the minting, the absence of deadlines and the 0% interest rate meant that for lending to succeed long-term, RUNE needed to maintain its value relative to Bitcoin and Ethereum.       As altcoins, including RUNE, began disconnecting from Bitcoin, concerns about THORFi grew. This sparked widespread debate regarding RUNE’s price and ways to stabilize it, along with the impact a declining RUNE price was having on THORFi. Negative discussions on platforms like Twitter and within Discord fueled uncertainty, which led to further price disconnection. This decline quickly became a self-fulfilling prophecy, compounding the situation beyond market trends alone.   Despite THORChain continuing to operate as intended during this period, RUNE’s price decline was driven primarily by panic selling fueled by speculation and negative chatter, rather than any underlying technical or operational issues. This feedback loop of fear and misinformation spiraled further, creating a price drop detached from the network’s actual performance.   Timeline of Key Events   January 9, 2025: JP THOR’s Temporary THORFi Pause   JP THOR used an admin key to temporarily pause Lending and Savers at 08:27 (UTC). He outlined a plan while giving Node Operators the option to reverse the pause.The pause was overturned by Node Operators at 15:07 (UTC) on the same day..   The event raised concerns about use of an Admin key within a decentralisation network. In response, development efforts were accelerated to permanently remove all Admin keys from THORChain. The code change was submitted in GitLab (merge request 3886), and is scheduled for release in THORNode version 3.2.0, pending adoption by Node Operators.   Additionally, the event intensified the debate over the risks posed by THORFi and contributed to market instability.   January 24, 2025: THORFi Pause by Node Vote   As concerns escalated over price volatility and declining liquidity, at 01:51 (UTC), four Nodes independently voted to pause Lending. Less than a minute later, Nine Realms proposed  pausing THORFi via Node Vote. Multiple Nodes further voted to suspend both Lending and Savers, with Savers being successfully paused at 01:52 (UTC).   The justification was rooted in the risk that loan closures would trigger significant RUNE minting, increasing supply and consequently reducing its price. This price reduction would lead to impermanent loss (IL) in the liquidity pools, exacerbated by synthetic asset leverage, which magnifies impermanent loss incurred by Dual Liquidity Providers (DLPs), significantly increasing the likelihood of DLPs suffering substantial losses or being left with nothing.   At the time of the pause, THORChain had accrued approximately $200 million in outstanding liabilities:      Savers: $96.22 million            BTC: $55.66 million       ETH: $16.11 million       Stablecoins: $9.94 million       Other Native Assets: $14.49 million           Lending: $105.66 million            BTC: $84.96 million       ETH: $20.7 million           A full list of liabilities and tracking can be found here https://thorfi-unwind.vercel.app/. A Replit has also been created.   January 30, 2025: Synth Yield Redirection   To reduce the impact Savers have on DLPers during the discussion period, at 17:52 (UTC), it was proposed that MaxSynthsForSaversYield and SynthYieldBasisPoints network parameters be set to 0.   This would ensure that all yield generated from Savers collateral was directed back to Liquidity Providers (LPs) instead of Savers. These changes took effect via Node Vote on January 31, 2025, at 23:46 (UTC).   February 2, 2025: Community Proposals and Node Vote   Following the pause, a discussion period began, during which any community member could submit a proposal to resolve the outstanding liabilities, unwind THORFi, and establish a path forward.   After discussions, a total of 8 independent proposals were presented to Node Operators to vote on. This was issued on February 2, 2025, at 00:25 (UTC).   February 3, 2025: Proposal 6 Approval   On February 3, 2025, at 08:45 (UTC), a majority of 67% of Node Operators formally approved Proposal 6 (author: AaluxxMyth, founder of Maya Protocol). An announcement was made approximately 5 minutes later.   Overview of Proposal 6   Convert defaulted debt to $TCY equity with no private raise   Proposal 6 outlines a comprehensive approach to addressing the approx $200 million in liabilities and unwinding THORFi:      Debt to Equity Conversion: $TCY, a new token, will be issued with a fixed supply of 200 million. Borrowers and Savers can claim one $TCY per $1 of their owed liability.   Revenue Sharing: $TCY holders will receive 10% of the network’s revenue in perpetuity, distributed daily in RUNE.   Liquidity Pool &amp; Market Exit: A RUNE/$TCY liquidity pool will be created, and seeded by the THORChain treasury. The treasury will also allocate $5 million to buybacks. As market demand for a share of THORChain’s revenue materialises in $TCY’s price, holders will have the flexibility to exit on their terms or hold for long-term revenue distributions.   Elimination of THORFi Products: Lending, Savers, PoL, and RUNEPool will be retired, and Liquidity Nodes will be introduced to increase capital efficiency and offset the revenue share allocated to $TCY holders.   Implementation Details of Proposal 6      The full implementation details have been published on GitLab with an amendment.   A node vote changed the Emission Curve to reduce the block rewards. This will reduce the block emissions from approx. This changes emissions from approx 25,000 RUNE a day to 2 RUNE a day, or 750 RUNE per year.   To support the amendment to proposal 6, MR3926 has been created to allow LP deposits to be paused on a specific chain.   Next Steps   The implementation of Proposal 6 will follow a structured process that ensures transparency, community involvement, and adherence to the Architecture Decision Record (ADR) process. The steps are as follows:      Based on the outcomes of the discussion, any required changes will be formalised in an ADR and voted on by Nodes.   Developers will make the necessary code updates to implement the approved ADR, including the $TCY claim process and revenue model changes. MR3924 is being developed to add $TCY.   Nodes will adopt the updated code in a new THORNode release.   Users will be able to claim their $TCY tokens once the implementation is live.   Conclusion   The THORFi unwind represents a pivotal moment in THORChain’s evolution. The network has demonstrated resilience and adaptability, navigating a complex and challenging situation while maintaining operational integrity. With Proposal 6 approved and development efforts underway, THORChain is positioned to emerge stronger and more robust.
